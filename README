Wearhouse (release 3-dev): a game made for Ludum Dare 25 (theme 'you are the
villain'), a puzzle platformer about infiltrating the bad guy's warehouse
hideout.  To help you do so, you can change your appearance to look like this
bad guy, using his conveniently-placed wardrobes.

This version has some post-competition updates.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x, 3.2 or later 3.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    RUNNING

To run from source, you must first compile.  This process requires GNU Make or
equivalent or the version of Visual whatever-it's-called that was used to
compile your Python version, and header files for SDL and Pygame must be
available on the system.  Just run

    make

On Windows, this requires the command-line compiler ('cl') to be on your path,
and assumes that SDL.h is in the directory 'sdl_include' above this directory
(horrible, I know).

The makefile supports a 'PYTHON_VERSION' argument which can be 2 (default) or
3, which determines which version to build for.

Now, on systems with a sh-compatible shell, do

    ./run

On other systems (Windows, for example), run run.py with your Python 2
executable.

    PLAYING

Move around each level and try to get to the elevator to the next floor.

    CONTROLS

arrow keys, WASD, space: move, jump, interact with objects
R: reset current level
escape, backspace: pause
q: quit when paused
F10: minimise

WASD and R are in the same place in Dvorak too.

You may also quit by closing the game window.
