This is a game made for Ludum Dare 25 (theme 'you are the villain').

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    RUNNING

This should work wherever Pygame does.  On systems with a sh-compatible shell,
do

    ./run

On other systems (Windows, for example), run game.py with your Python 2
executable.

    CONTROLS

arrow keys, WASD, space: move, jump, interact with objects
R: reset current level
F11, alt + enter: toggle fullscreen

WASD and R are in the same place in Dvorak, AZERTY and Colemak too.
