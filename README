Wearhouse (release 2): a game made for Ludum Dare 25 (theme 'you are the
villain'), a puzzle platformer about infiltrating the bad guy's warehouse
hideout.  To help you do so, you can change your appearance to look like this
bad guy, using his usefully-placed wardrobes.

This version has some post-competition updates.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    RUNNING

This should work wherever Pygame does.  On systems with a sh-compatible shell,
do

    ./run

On other systems (Windows, for example), run game.py with your Python 2
executable.

    PLAYING

Move around each level and try to get to the elevator to the next floor.

    CONTROLS

arrow keys, WASD, space: move, jump, interact with objects
R: reset current level
F11, alt + enter: toggle fullscreen
F10: minimise
escape, backspace: quit

WASD and R are in the same place in Dvorak too.
